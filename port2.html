                    <h4 class="fw-light">I pretty much just did everything that I could possibly do to ensure success for my team and for our users. Sometimes, this means that I need to come up with innovative product marketing strategies and directions.

                    <h4 class="fw-light"> Flashback to September of 2020: as KiwiLink’s iOS and Android launch came closer and closer, I felt increasingly excited and pumped, but also increasingly anxious, since I had never marketed an app before
                    </h4>
                    <h4 class="fw-light"> During ideation sessions w/ my awesome teammates, I was interested in asking, “how can we use our marketing to both boost our app AND boost the UW community at the same time?”

                    <h4 class="fw-light">
                        In the end, I decided to go with a series of collaborative marketing efforts where we team up with prominent clubs from the University of Washington. 
                    </h4>
                    <h4 class="fw-light"> 
                        After persistently pitching to dozens of clubs, I was able to set up a deal with roughly 10 prominent clubs from the University of Washington (including DubHacks and CSA)
                    </h4>
                    <h4 class="fw-light"> 
                        We agreed to use post free advertising for those clubs on the KiwiLink app (in exchange for the clubs doing marketing for KiwiLink on social media and beyond)                    </h4>
                    <h4 class="fw-light">

                    <h4 class="fw-light"> 
                        One roadblock we had to deal with was that KiwiLink (at the time) didn’t have an elegant way to display ads on its interface.                     </h4>
                    <h4 class="fw-light"> 
                        I didn’t want to bombard users with pop up ads that would detract from the beauty/simplicity of the current user experience in the study buddy finder interface.

                    <h4 class="fw-light"> 
                        After exploring solutions with my UX team, we decided that we would add a new separate feature to KiwiLink called “Billboard,” which only shows relevant promos and ads from UW clubs
                    </h4>
                    <h4 class="fw-light">

                    <h4 class="fw-light"> 
                        - shows relevant ads and announcements from official UW clubs and partners

                        - exists in a separate tab from the friends explorer page (doesn't add clutter)

                    <h4 class="fw-light"> 
                        Everybody was satisfied with this compromise (clubs got extra attention and traffic, and KiwiLink users kept enjoying their user experience)!

                        I learned a lot and gained a lot from leading this product marketing campaign!!!

                    <h4 class="fw-light"> 
                        In the end, our collaborative community building marketing efforts were highly successful and highly educational for me. 
                    </h4>
                    <h4 class="fw-light">
                        As a result of this marketing campaign and billboard launch, KiwiLink’s user base doubled (from around 800 users to around 1,600 users. Now, we see that KiwiLink hosts over 2,500 users!)
                    </h4>

                    <h4 class="fw-light"> 
                        And we were able to help those 10 student-driven-clubs at UW increase overall club attendance by about 20%. 
                    </h4>
                    <h4 class="fw-light"> 
                        As well, we were noticed by the UW College of Engineering, and we eventually worked out a partnership deal.                    </h4>
                    <h4 class="fw-light"> 
                        To celebrate this great success, I led my team in throwing a huge party in UDistrict; we invited KiwiLink contributors, club partners, and KiwiLink users to come enjoy some Soju and hotdogs. What a great time!
                    </h4>
                    <h4 class="fw-light"> 
                        From this experience, I reaffirmed to myself that it’s fun to build great products by building great relationships.
